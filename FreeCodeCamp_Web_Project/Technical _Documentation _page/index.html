          Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should
          start learning after HTML. While HTML is used to define the structure
          and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out.
          For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and
          spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add
          animations and other decorative features

          You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We
          recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML module first.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS,starting with the introduction to CSS module</li>
            <li>More advanced HTML modules</li>
            <li>Javascript, and hoe to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you
          learn further HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth
          between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting
          and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't learn CSS
          without knowing HTML.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using
          computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it,
          consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set
          up as detailed in Installing basic software and understand how to
          create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files — both of
          which are parts of our Getting started with the web complete
          beginner's module.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also recommended that you work through Getting started with the
          web before proceeding with this topic, especially if you are
          completely new to web development. However, much of what is covered in
          its CSS basics article is also covered in our CSS first steps module,
          albeit in a lot more detail.

          This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for
          working through them. You should start with the first one.
        </p>
        <h1>CSS First Steps</h1>
        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages —
          for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
          content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
          decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your
          path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
          syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
          HTML.
        </p>
        <h4>CSS Syntax</h4>
        <p>Selector { property:value; property2:value2}</p>
        <pre>
            <code> p{ color:red;
                text-align:center;}</code>
        </pre>
        <h3>CSS building blocks</h3>
        <p>
          This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've
          gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some
          basic experience with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper. This
          module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we
          have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders,
          debugging, and lots more. The aim here is to provide you with a
          toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
          essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like
          text styling and CSS layout.
        </p>
        <h3>Styling text</h3>
        <p>
          With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for
          you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things
          you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals,
          including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing,
          drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by
          looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and
          links
        </p>
        <h4>CSS Comment</h4>
        <pre>
            <code>/* This is a single-line comment */
                p {
                  color: red;
                }</code>
        </pre>
        <h3>CSS layout</h3>
        <p>
          At this point, we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style
          text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits
          inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right
          place with respect to the viewport, and one another. We have covered
          the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout,
          looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like
          flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques
          you might still want to know about.

      <section class="main-section" id="Use_CSS">
        <header>Use CSS</header>
        <p>There are 3 ways to use CSS</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS</li>
          <li>Internal CSS</li>
          <li>External CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Inline CSS</h3>
        <pre>
                <code>&lt;button style="color:purple"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button</code>
            </pre>
        <h3>Internal CSS</h3>
        <pre>
                <code>&lt;style&gt;
                    button { 
                        color:purple; 
                    } 
                &lt;/style&gt;</code>
            </pre>
        <h3>External CSS</h3>
        <p>In another CSS file we can have:</p>
        <pre>
                <code>button {
                    color:purple;
                }
                </code></pre>
        <p>And then import it into the HTML using the link tag</p>
        <pre>
                <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/&gt;</code>
            </pre>

      <section class="main-section" id="Solving_common_CSS_problems">
        <header>Solving common CSS problems</header>
        <p>
          Use CSS to solve common problems provides links to sections of content
          explaining how to use CSS to solve very common problems when creating
          a web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements and
          their backgrounds; change the size, shape, and position of elements;
          and add and define borders on elements. But there's not much you can't
          do once you have a solid understanding of even the basics of CSS. One
          of the best things about learning CSS is that once you know the
          fundamentals, usually you have a pretty good feel for what can and
          can't be done, even if you don't know how to do it yet!
        </p>
        <h3>"CSS is weird"</h3>
        <p>
          CSS works a bit differently from most programming languages and design
          tools you'll come across. Why does it work the way it does? In the
          following video, Miriam Suzanne provides a useful explanation of why
          CSS works as it does, and why it has evolved as it has:
